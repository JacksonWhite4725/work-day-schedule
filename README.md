# Work Day Schedule

This work day schedule is built to allow users to plan their day. The schedule is strictly catered towards a 9-5 environment, where past hours are highlighted in gray, the current hour is red, and future hours are highlighted in green. A user is allowed to type an event into the calendar for each hour, and click the save button to log the information into local storage.
